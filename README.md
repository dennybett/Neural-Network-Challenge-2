## Neural Networks Challenge 2

### Department and Attrition Model

#### Project description

In this project, I was tasked with creating a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. 

Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so I was also tasked with predicting the department that best fits each employee. 

I used a branched neural network model to predict these scenarios.
